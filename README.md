# US H1-B Petitions Analysis

**Data:**
The data we worked on in this term project is H-1B Visa Petitions 2011-2016 which we took from Kaggle. The data contained about three million records of H1-B Visa Petitions from the year 2011 till the year 2016. This was too much data to be processed so we reduced the data by just extracting the records of ‘COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS’, ‘BUSINESS ANALYST’, ‘ACCOUNTANT’ and ‘CONSULTANT’ from the ‘JOB TITLE’ column. Thus we were left with around 140000 records of H1-B petitions.
Further refining of data was done in R before the analysis which was done in Tableau. The R code is provided in the form of a jupyter notebook with the name "H1-B.ipynb".

**Scope:**
The scope of our analysis was to first analyse the number of petitions in different ways for example the total number of petitions from various cities over the years, total number of petitions from various states over the years, number of petitions from various Companies each year and total number of petitions for different JOB TITLES that we had selected.
This was done to get to know the trend and scenarios over the years before going on to predict something for 2017. This was also some kind of validation, as it is generally known that since there is Silicon Valley in California the number of petitions from California will be very high. But we also got to know many different things like most of the petitions came form the east coast and the west coast and there were relatively very few companies which filed H1-B petitions in central America. THIS ANALYSIS WILL HELP US IN FINDING COMPANIES AND LOCATIONS WHICH WE NEED TO APPLY TO DURING OUR JOB SEARCH AFTER COMPLETING GRADUATION.
Given the current scenario of H1-B visas in America and already having seen a dip in number of petitions in 2016 in the analysis done above, we wanted to forecast/predict how many number of petitions are going to be filed in 2017.

**Future Scope:**
We are looking forward to obtain the new data of 2017 whenever it is released and compare it with our estimation to get the effect the presedential election of 2016 had on H1-B petitions being filed.
